Chosen feature: 
A search feature based on car maker, year of manufacture, price range 
and a search based on all three factors.

How does it work:
A feature called "Search Cars" in the drawer menu of MainActivity will start a new activity (1)
that contains the search feature, where user have the choice to search based on the
car maker only, the year only, the price range only or with all three. After user has chosen
what type of search they want, the activity will then start another new activity (2) that displays
the result of the query requested by the user in a card layout implemented using recycler view.
Activities (1) and (2) both have a floating action button with an arrow icon that when pressed will
redirect user to the previous activity, and activity (1) has a floating action button with a trash
icon that will clear all the text in all search fields.
